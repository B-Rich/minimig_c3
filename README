Fampiga_C3 is a port of the Minimig core to a generic Cyclone III FPGA board.

It's based closely on the Chameleon 64 port by Tobias Gubener, a version of which
can be found in one of my other repositories.  That was itself forked from a version
hosted by Christian Vogelgsang.

While the C3 board port probably won't be much use to other people, since it requires
custom IO boards, I hope ultimately to have a Chameleon version building from the
same source tree.  The C3 board is somewhat easier to develop for than the Chameleon
despite being very similar hardware-wide, so this project is basically intended to be
a testbed for improvements to the core, which I hope to bring back to the Chameleon
as time goes on.
